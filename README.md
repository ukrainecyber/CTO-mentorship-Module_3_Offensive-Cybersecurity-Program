# CTO Mentoring Program: Module 3

The USAID Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure in Ukraine Activity created five repositories with materials developed for CTO mentorship program in 2021.

The third module of this program is dedicated to Offensive Cybersecurity and covers from the most basic offerings to the most mature aspects of cybersecurity.

As any good military strategist or sports enthusiast can attest: the best defense is a good offense. Cybersecurity is no exception to this adage. So letâ€™s take a closer look at what Offensive Security is, and how can it help an organization. 
At its core, Offensive Security exists to identify issues before they are detected and utilized by external and malicious actors. The term Offensive Security is an umbrella term that covers several aspects of cybersecurity.  

All training materials are prepared in English and Ukrainian languages accompanied with the whitepapers from the international experts in English.

These materials were prepared by Catalisto LLC for the USAID Cybersecurity for Critical Infrastructure in Ukraine Activity.
